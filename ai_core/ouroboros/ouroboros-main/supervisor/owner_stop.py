"""Owner graceful stop ("Wrap up" / finalize-then-stop, Q1/Q2/Q3=A/Q6=A, 2026-08-15).

The policy half of the S3 cancel-finalization design, kept OUT of the pinned
``supervisor/task_lifecycle.py`` (which keeps a line-neutral dispatch at the
intent sweep) and ``supervisor/queue.py`` (which keeps one typed predicate in
its timeout enforcement):

- the durable cancel intent (``ouroboros/cancel_intents.py``) with
  ``stop_policy=finalize_then_cancel`` is the ONLY owner will — no second
  ledger, timer, or lease;
- the grace episode REUSES the existing coupled ``finalize_now`` control +
  RUNNING-row latch (``task_reaper.request_finalization_grace``), with the
  episode/control identity derived deterministically from the durable stop
  ``request_id`` so watchdog/restart replays never mint a duplicate control;
- ``sweep_cancel_intents`` calls ``sweep_owner_stop_hold`` per open intent:
  before the shared deadline the episode is armed/held (custody NOT fed);
  at the deadline, on a settled result, or after an immediate upgrade the
  generic custody feed proceeds — the existing custody stays the only killer;
- Q6=A cascade: live descendants are hard-settled deepest-first with ZERO paid
  turns through the existing subtree sweep, then only the root's one bounded
  tool-less turn runs over the preserved child results.

Panic and every non-graceful cancel are untouched: absence of the explicit
policy is byte-identical immediate hard cancellation (§13.1).
