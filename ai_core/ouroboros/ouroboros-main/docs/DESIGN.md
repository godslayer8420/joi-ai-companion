# Ouroboros Design System

Normative authority for the **visual and interaction semantics** of the Ouroboros
UI: what a size means, what a colour claims, what a chip is allowed to say.

Authority split:

- **This file** decides semantics — type scale, hierarchy, foreground and state
  colour, status conventions, card/row anatomy, density.
- **`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` → `## Design System`** decides the engineering rules
  that keep those semantics intact — where values may live, which component is
  the SSOT, what counts as review debt, how a visual change is verified.

Values themselves live in `web/style.css` `:root` (and are mirrored by value in
`web/onboarding.css`, which is inlined standalone and cannot import it). This
file names roles; it does not copy an inventory.

The theme is **dark only**. There is no light-theme plumbing, and adding a
second theme is an architecture change, not a styling change.

## 1. Type scale

Four sizes. There is no fifth.

| Token | Value | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--type-meta` | 12px | Labels, notes, chips, timing/quota lines, captions |
| `--type-body` | 14px | Default reading text, values, controls, row titles |
| `--type-section` | 16px | Section and card titles |
| `--type-page` | 24px | Page / wizard step title, and display text (a login code) |

Line heights: `--line-meta` (1.35) for short meta lines, `--line-body` (1.5) for
prose, `--line-title` (1.3) for headings.

Rules:

- A value with no exact token **rounds to the nearest token**. It never mints a
  fifth size. 13px becomes `--type-body`, 15px becomes `--type-section`, 11px
  becomes `--type-meta`.
- **No new raw `10px` / `11px` text on a migrated surface.** Below 12px the
  dark theme forces a choice between illegible and glaring, and the glaring
  option is what produced the owner's "too much small high-contrast white text"
  report. `tests/test_web_typography_static.py` enforces this.
- Control chrome keeps its own dimension tokens (`--button-font-size`,
  `--pill-font-size`). They are control geometry, not the reading scale; do not
  replace them with type tokens or vice versa.

## 2. Hierarchy rule

**In any row, card or field, exactly one thing is primary.** Everything else
steps down. Concretely:

- **Label** → `--type-meta` in `--text-meta`, sentence case.
- **Value** (the thing the owner came to read or change) → `--type-body` in
  `--text-primary`.
- **Meta** (last run, quota, effort, timing, provenance) → `--type-meta` in
  `--text-meta`.
- **Section title** → `--type-section` semibold; **subsection heading** →
  `--type-body` semibold. A bare `<h3>`/`<h4>`/`<strong>` that inherits the
  browser default is a defect: it lands at bold 16px full white and ties with,
  or beats, the content it introduces.

**The 12px UPPERCASE label pattern is retired** on migrated surfaces. All-caps
at a small size costs legibility, widens every label, and when a panel repeats
it dozens of times the labels collectively out-shout the values they describe.
Authored label strings should read as sentence case; CSS must not manufacture
caps with `text-transform`.

## 3. Foreground and state colour

| Token | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--text-primary` | The one thing this row/card is about; interactive control labels |
| `--text-meta` | Real secondary content: labels, notes, hints, meta lines |
| `--text-disabled` | Genuinely inert or incidental content only |

`--text-muted` is a legacy alias of `--text-disabled`; new work names
`--text-meta` or `--text-disabled` so the intent is readable in the diff.

Two failure modes this table exists to prevent, both observed in this codebase:

- **Secondary content parked at the disabled foreground.** A load-bearing
  caveat rendered at `--text-disabled` reads as greyed-out chrome and gets
  skipped. If the owner is meant to read it, it is `--text-meta`.
- **Secondary content with no foreground at all**, inheriting `--text-primary`.
  This is the loudest of all failures because it is invisible in the CSS — the
  rule simply declares a size and says nothing about colour.

### `.muted`

`.muted` is a **colour-only utility**: `color: var(--text-meta)`, nothing else.
It must never set `font-size`. It is written at ~50 call sites that already
sized themselves, and a size here would silently resize all of them. A scoped
rule (`.some-context .muted`) still wins on specificity where a surface needs a
local variant.

### Dark-theme contrast

WCAG 4.5:1 is a **floor, not a target**. On near-black, pushing small text
toward pure white causes halation — the glyphs bloom, and because everything is
maximally bright, nothing is emphasised. The result is a screen that is
simultaneously harder to read and flatter in hierarchy.

**De-emphasise the secondary rather than amplifying the primary.** When
something needs to stand out, drop the ink around it, do not raise its own. All
Primary (15.9:1) and meta (9.2:1) clear the 4.5:1 floor against `--bg-primary`
with room to spare. `--text-disabled` is deliberately BELOW it (3.5:1) and is
therefore reserved for genuinely disabled or incidental content, which WCAG
exempts; it must never carry meaning a reader has to obtain.

## 4. Status and chips

A status has **an explicit foreground/background pair**, never a foreground
derived from whatever generic opacity happens to sit on the element.

| Role | Foreground | Background |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Success / connected | `--status-ok-fg` | `--status-ok-bg` |
| Warning / degraded | `--status-warn-fg` | `--status-warn-bg` |
| Error / failed | `--status-error-fg` | `--status-error-bg` |
| Neutral / classification | `--status-neutral-fg` | `--status-neutral-bg` |

- **Status renders as dot + text.** The dot carries the state at a glance, so
  the sentence does not have to shout it in saturated colour and can sit at
  ordinary reading contrast.
- **Neutral is a real state**, not an absence of one. A classification chip
  (which agent, which family) is neutral: it is a tag, not an alarm.
  A tone value the code actually emits (`muted`) must have a rule; falling
  through to a default is how chips end up white.
- Chips are `--type-meta`, not smaller, and are not uppercased.
- `--tone-ok` / `--tone-warn` / `--tone-danger` remain the saturated role hues
  for large fills, borders and indicators. The `--status-*-fg` tints are for
  12px text on near-black; do not swap them.

## 5. Card and section composition

- A panel is one `.ui-card`-family surface: `--ui-card-border`,
  `--ui-card-bg`, `--radius`. Nested emphasis uses `--ui-card-bg-soft`, not a
  second border weight.
- A section is: title (`--type-section`) → optional one-paragraph description
  (`--type-body`, `--text-meta`) → content → optional note (`--type-meta`,
  `--text-meta`). The description explains what the section decides; the note
  carries consequences and caveats.
- Subsections inside a section use a `--type-body` semibold heading and stay
  visually grouped with their own rows and their own action toolbar. A heading
  that floats equidistant between two groups belongs to neither.
- Spacing comes from the 8pt tokens (`--space-*`); a new visual dimension
  becomes a CSS variable before it becomes a page-local literal.

## 6. Account group / row anatomy

For a repeated identity row (a connected agent account, a reviewer slot,
a server entry):

1. **Classification chip** — neutral pair, `--type-meta`. Only where the row's
   family is not already expressed by the group it sits in; inside a per-family
   card the chip repeats the header and is dropped.
2. **Name** — `--type-body` semibold, `--text-primary`. The one primary thing.
3. **Identity detail** (email, plan) — `--type-meta`, `--text-meta`.
4. **Status** — dot + text from the status pairs.
5. **Meta line** — `--type-meta`, `--text-meta`, on its own line under the
   name. Quantities are stated in human words ("38% used · resets in 2h"), and
   an instant is humanized. A row never leads with a raw ISO timestamp.
6. **Actions** — docked right, legible at rest. A control rendered at
   secondary ink reads as disabled; if the owner can click it, it is
   `--text-primary`.

Rows of the same kind are equivalent: no row gets extra visual weight for
being first, default, or native. Grouping and section-level actions express
which family a row belongs to, and a section-level action (add, connect)
belongs in its group's header rather than attached to one privileged row.

**A degraded row is emphasised, not dimmed.** Lowering a whole row's opacity
greys out the sentence that reports the problem and makes its still-clickable
controls read as disabled. Tint the row with the matching `--status-*-bg`
instead, and let the status text carry the claim.

## 7. Onboarding density

The first-run wizard is a compact flow that must not scroll at the default
desktop window size merely because a step has several fields.

- Step title `--type-page`; card titles `--type-section`; field labels and
  notes `--type-meta`. No display size above `--type-page`.
- Short-viewport adaptation hides explanatory copy rather than shrinking type.
  Once copy is hidden, shaving pixels off a title buys nothing and costs the
  scale.
- Field labels are sentence case at meta ink — a wizard step shows a dozen at
  once, and its job is to get one value typed, not to present a grid of
  headings.

## 8. Migration state

The scale is applied surface by surface. Migrated today:

- `web/settings.css` (settings shell, model/effort cards, MCP cards)
- `web/onboarding.css` (the whole first-run wizard)
- `web/style.css` between the `design-system:migrated-begin` and
  `design-system:migrated-end` markers — harness accounts and reviewer slots
- the global `.muted`, `.form-section h3` and shared `.ui-status` tone rules

Not yet migrated: chat, skills, marketplace, widgets, logs, evolution. They are
historical and keep their literals until their own pass. Do not part-migrate a
surface: a half-tokenised stylesheet is harder to reason about than an untouched
one.

`tests/test_web_typography_static.py` guards the migrated set only. Extending
the guard to a new surface and migrating that surface are the same commit.
