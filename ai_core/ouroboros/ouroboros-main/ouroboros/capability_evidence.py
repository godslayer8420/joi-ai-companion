"""Capability Evidence — sourced, auditable knowledge of a route's context window.

Replaces the stale static per-model window table (deleted in v6.33.0). Every
window claim is EVIDENCE with a status and a source, scoped to a route
fingerprint (provider + base_url + model + headers/beta + relevant options):

  status:
    confirmed   — a trustworthy live/local source reported it
                  (source = provider_metadata | local_health)
    asserted    — the owner acknowledged it for an EXACT route fingerprint
                  (source = owner_ack); auditable, invalidated on ANY route change
    unprobeable — no metadata source and no owner-ack (e.g. OpenAI/Anthropic
                  direct, whose 1M is an undiscoverable per-request beta header)
    failed      — a probe was attempted and errored (transient; retried later)

``unknown`` (unprobeable | failed | no record) => FAIL-CLOSED for any >=1M gate.

Probes are opportunistic and cached (24h for confirmed, 10 min for failed). Gate
readers pass ``allow_fetch=False`` so the hot path never blocks on a network
call. A provider outage marks evidence stale; it never erases a prior confirmed/
asserted record. The owner-ack is route-fingerprinted and NEVER a repo-wide
"trust this model" flag.
