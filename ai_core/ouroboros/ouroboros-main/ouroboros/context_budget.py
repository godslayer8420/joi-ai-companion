"""Single source of truth for AGENT-context size budgets.

These govern the size of Ouroboros's OWN working context: the main-loop
assembled prompt, the typed context-reclaim request/receipt contract, and
the background consciousness context guards.

They are deliberately SEPARATE from the REVIEW-prompt budget family
(``ouroboros.tools.review_helpers.REVIEW_PROMPT_TOKEN_BUDGET`` and the
``ouroboros.tools.scope_review`` window constants), which sizes reviewer
prompts, not the agent's own context. Merging the two would couple unrelated
concerns and is explicitly avoided.

Constants, frozen context-reclaim records, and pure classification helpers
only. This module must stay import-pure: no imports from ``ouroboros.llm``,
``ouroboros.loop*``, or any other runtime module, so every seam can import
the shared vocabulary without cycles.

Char-based guards assume the ~chars/4 estimate (``ouroboros.utils.estimate_tokens``);
the comments give the approximate token equivalents.
