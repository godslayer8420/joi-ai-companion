"""Launcher wrapper for the EXTERNAL CL-Bench (continual-learning-bench) runner.

CL-Bench (continual-learning-bench.com, arXiv 2606.05661) feeds a system a
STRICTLY SEQUENTIAL stream of task instances and measures continual learning:
a memoryless *stateless* baseline vs a *stateful* rollout where one persistent
system carries state across the whole ordered sequence. For Ouroboros the
carried state is its native MEMORY (scratchpad/knowledge), which is the whole
point of running this bench — so runs go against a LIVE agent with memory ON,
and cross-task parallelism is FORBIDDEN by the bench design.

This wrapper does NOT reimplement the benchmark. The runner, its tasks, its
scoring, and the in-runner Ouroboros adapter (``src/systems/ouroboros/``,
pinned at commit 56764d6 in the run handoff bundle) live in the external
``continual-learning-bench`` repository, which must be obtained separately and
pointed at via ``--runner-path``. The wrapper adds the house launch pattern:

- fresh append-only run root under ``bench_runs/continual_learning/``;
- per-run settings rendered from ``settings_base.json`` (secrets blanked in
  the on-disk copy; live keys travel via child env only);
- a ``run_manifest.json`` with provenance + an explicit template-fidelity
  report (which template knobs the pinned external adapter actually enforces);
- normalized ``results.json`` + denominator-preserving ``result_index.jsonl``
  collected from the runner's per-question trace artifacts.

Two observed entrypoints of the external repo are supported:

- ``standard``: ``python run_benchmark.py run <domain> --system ouroboros
  --system-params '{...}' --task.schedule default --runs 1 --max-workers 1
  --no-live-dashboard`` (the adapter METHODOLOGY's "clean path": per-action
  interaction, runner owns the loop, evaluate() once at the end).
- ``bridge``: ``python -m src.systems.ouroboros.run_clbench_bridge_agent ...``
  (one whole Ouroboros agent task per question via the host-side shim; this is
  what produced the reference full40 DB run of 2026-07-01).

Official scoring stays with the external runner/leaderboard scripts; the
normalized results here are audit sidecars, not replacement scoring.
