"""Static guard: the typography scale holds on the surfaces that adopted it.

The owner's report was "too much small high-contrast white text". Four
independent causes produced it (docs/DESIGN.md):

1. ``class="muted"`` was written at ~50 call sites while the ONLY rule that
   matched it was the scoped ``.marketplace-card-title .muted`` — so muted text
   everywhere else inherited near-white ``--text-primary``;
2. ``.harness-chip`` / ``.reviewer-slot-meta`` declared a size and no colour,
   inheriting the same primary ink;
3. field labels were 12px UPPERCASE at a hand-written ``rgba(255,255,255,.68)``,
   repeated dozens of times per panel;
4. there was no scale at all — every size was a literal px, across three
   mutually inconsistent grey families.

This guard keeps that class closed on the **migrated** surfaces only. It is
deliberately NOT a sweep of the historical stylesheet: ``web/style.css`` is
~6000 lines of unmigrated chat/skills/marketplace/widget rules whose literals
are a later pass, and a guard that fails on all of them would be turned off.
The migrated slice of ``style.css`` is delimited in the file itself by
``design-system:migrated-begin`` / ``design-system:migrated-end`` markers, so
migrating a new surface means moving a marker (or adding a file below) in the
same commit that migrates it.

Pattern follows ``tests/test_web_dialogs_static.py``: read the sources, assert
the structural fact, no browser needed.
